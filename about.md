I am Saurabh Tiwari, I started my life from a single Cell and now I have
multiplied to a 100 trillion.
I am currently working as an Applications Developer-II at Oracle Corporation
(FSGBU).
I am one of those gentically mutated people whose sleeping cycles allow them to
sleep only for 3-4 hour a day and still remain as lively as others. 
I earn my living by writing code. I am pretty passionate about coding and
learning new stuff everyday.
I am a firm believer of the philosophy that life is a continuous process of
evolution. 
I find the challenges of Machine Learning and Natural Language processing pretty
intriguing and it has motivated me to develop a REGEX text parser.

Does my work intrgues you? Feel free to leave your inputs on

My Text processor resides here:
