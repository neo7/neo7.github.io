Hi All, 

Writing after a pretty long time, one of my old friend Shashwat Anand pointed me
out that I have a blog that was pdated three months ago. 

Today I have fixed a graphics issue of my laptop, so I am really valuing the gem
that I have. 

I have a Linux Fedora machine (v15 Lovelock). 
It feels so great when you have your machine working, its like you got your lost
ove back in the right place.

So let me throw some light on the XFCE story.
So what is XFCE, its a light weight, highly productive desktop session that I
instaled but later on forgot to use. :P

Why am I using it?

A. I am using it because ForceFallBack mode of Gnome Shell went kaput and I am
left with KDE and XFCE. 

Since KDE is something that is pretty much windows based, so I started XFCE.

Its the favouite of Linus torvalds. (Not adding Stallman to this list, he loves
his Command Line interface and elinks more than anything else.)

So the first challenge was to make the mouse tap work. 

I used this command to make my XFCE experience better.

`"synclient TapButton1=1 "`

I remember using this desktop session very long ago, but I don't know why I
changed to the Gnome Shell.

Happy Hacking.
