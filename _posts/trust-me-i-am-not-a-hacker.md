title: Trust me I am not a Hacker
---

The title of this post pleads my readers to trust me. Yes, Indeed I'm not a
hacker and I have never been one.

With remniscence of the recent past that was unleashed by a social internet
activist Edward Snowden. The only crime that guy did was that he revealed the
about the project PRISM and the suporting operations of The NSA which actually
hampers the privacy of the users.

Well, frankly according to me, internet was the only place where I  felt that I
*WAS* a free-soul and nobody holds a chance to intrude into  my personal life,
but recently the world is bombarded with a series of  events which relates to
the security and the privacy of the users.
We  all have maintained two lives as of now, we all are spending an ample  amout
of time in social networking sites like facebook, google plus and  many other
but we forget that Facebook and Google are actually going to  use our data, they
build a separate user portfolio, his likes, dislikes.

Meanwhile facebook is providing enough data through their APIs and if  you write
a good algorithm you can easily spot someone's secret  "Crush", their "EX" or
their *To BE*. All you need is to properly supply  the inputs of the FB to your
FB Application. For this you will actually  have to create a Prediction model of
your own, because FB is smart  enough to keep the prediction ideas to themselves
and let users decide  what to do with the Statistical data which is being
provided.

We all don't just add the known people on fb, some of the people that  we add
are those, who we have not even met and sometimes those who  don't even hold a
chance to meet in the future. Do we really want them  to know so much about our
personal lives. The answer from all around the  world is a simple *No*

From the above statements it might seem that I'm an FB hater but  actually I'm
not. I was just trying to explain that in the worldwide  monitoring of NSA it
might be one of the cases that your Statistical  data might be given to some of
the people for observation and analysis.  Those statistical data can be
sometimes right or may be wrong.

I'm from India and I have nothing to do with NSA's project PRISM but  India is
about to launch the same programme of national survelliance of  Telephony and
Intenet Data. 
**NSA once said that the data  which they are recording is very likely not to be
used. Their promise  seems analogous to the person who downloads a Pirated movie
and promises  not to watch it. **

For The Gov Of India I can say that its a nice move, I have full faith in you
but I don't trust your contractors. 
Since India lags in survelliance devices they are very likely to move the
programme to some contractors. 

So what are the pros and cons of this scenario:

Pros (There will be sarcasm in every point)
0. Suspecting everybody as a terrorist, will eventually make people not choose
terrorism as a future career plan.
1. Lesser number of inland terrorist activities since terrorist plan everything
on phone and email. 
2.  Lesser protests as the emails and phone calls sent to protestors will  very
likely disclose the location of the people protesting.
3. The  right salesman on your door, as you just talked to your neighbour that
your mobile is not working anymore, Gov of India knows it, so they will  send
the person concerned on your doorstep. 

Cons: (No Sarcasm intended.)
0.  Your personal data your stats are with thirdparty. Every potential  *buyer*
citizen will be worth a lakh to the advertizer, your data can  easily be
compromised with the third party contractor (As the saying  goes- I trust the
government but not their Contractors)
1. Since your  data is not secure any idea or any strategy can be sent to the
competing organization. This will be highly dangerous and is an added  advantage
to the counter strategist. 
2. Your personal life may not be personal anymore. Making you suspect like a
terrorist makes you a non valued citizen of India.
If you consider Government as your friend, you will very likely be into a
situation like this-
Your  Friend forcefully makes you discuss your new idea with you then he goes
on implementing that idea before you and captures the market.

**The Above 3 reasons are enough for your to understand your  value and it gives
you enough authority to question the governements  plan. **

I am assuming that the reader of the post is a normal citizen like me  and does
not hold a lot of power in the Central Gov so here is  something which is worth
doing.

You must use encryption technique to hide your data from being monitored.

The best technique till this date is GPG, I have been using it for the past 3
years. 

Before I go ahead, let me tell you the reason why I started using GPG.
I started using GPG because of the OSS movement, I became a fan of Richard M
Stallman (RMS).
I  liked the ideology of RMS, his thinking about the privacy of an  individual,
How facebook and the other enterprise like google will use  your data and can
anytime produce your data to any other organization  whenever required.

**So what exactly happens with GPG: **

GnuPG encrypts messages using asymmetric keypairs  individually  generated by
GnuPG users. The resulting public keys can be  exchanged  with other users in a
variety of ways, such as Internet key servers.   They must always be exchanged
carefully to prevent identity spoofing by   corrupting public key â†” "owner"
identity correspondences. It is also   possible to add a cryptographic digital
signature  to a message, so the  message integrity and sender can be verified,
if a  particular  correspondence relied upon has not been corrupted.

&nbsp;

**How to move in the direction of Messaging with GnuPG:**

There are several tools available for Linux Based OSes and Mac OS.
For an easy operatibility they are now coming with GUI frontends and command
line was also pretty easy.

1. You first need to generate your key, for the email id that you want.

2. There will be two keys, one is the private key and the other is  the public
key, the public key will be used to encrypt messages which  are designated to
you. The private key is used for decrypting your  message, its a passphrase
which is asked while creating the RSA keys. 
2.1  You all must be thinking why pass-phrase and not password, its simple
because we don't want the Agencies to do a bruteforce attack on the  messages.
If you have chosen a difficult combination then it would take  the agencies,
around 10 years, with their million dollar CLUSTER, to  decode the message that
talks about birthday present of your  grandmother. 
2.2 Heads up for the present because this was not  guided by the Machine
learning Algorithms of Google/Amazon/Flipkart. It  was originally yours. 

3. Once you are finished creating keys you just need to use the plugins for your
email client.
For mac your can use the GPG suite that goes with the name of
[GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org/ "GPGTools") - It will even help you in creating
the keys and encrypting other messages too.
For Thunderbird you would want to use the famous
[Enigmail](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/
"Enigmail") 
I am more of a
[Evolution](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Using_GPG_with_Evolution "Evolution")
fan because it already has GPG/PGP security in the newer version.

4.  Once you are done with the above setup all you need is to send your
messages to your friends, relatives and colleagues&nbsp; and you may also
encourage them to use it. 

5. Keep the passphrase/private key safe, if you lose it there is no way you can
get it back. 
5.1  If you are a terrorist or a mafia, Agencies can still beat the shit out  of
you to get the message with complete meaning without using a million  dollar
cluster server.

6. You can also digitally sign your  messages, which will authenticate that you
are a genuine sender and not a  hoax who is trying to spam from some other
un-authentic source. Adding a  PGP signature at the end of your message shows a
greater sense of  responsibility for your messages. 

7. Your ideas will remain yours, your friends and your enemy don't hold a chance
of knowing it without your permission.

Its totally your choice to make the public keys open to the world so   that
anybody can send you encrypted messages or you can keep it private   among your
circles.
